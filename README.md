### Project ###
In this project, I was provided with a simple Flask app and tasked with modifying it to add components. This project was completed within approximately 30 minutes as part of a programming assessment.

### Getting Started ###
Clone this repository to your local machine.
This app is meant to be used with IDE like VSCode.

The program assumes that you have python3 and pip3 installed on your machine.
In the VSCode terminal window type the following:
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
In VSCode, press Cmd-Shift-P (on Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-P (on Windows).
   In the command selection text box, type "Python Create"
   From the options dropdown select "Python Create Environment"
   From the next options dropdown select "venv"
After the above and setting up the database, you should be able to run and debug this program

### Skill Development ###
This project allowed me to display my skills in modifying routes and components of Flask applications.
